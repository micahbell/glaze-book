        What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? Hahahahah! Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass.<br><br>

I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Fried cheese… with club sauce.<br><br>

        And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. Speaking of settling, How's Ann?
